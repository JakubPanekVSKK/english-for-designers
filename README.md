Awesome does not feel so awesome anymore

In today's fast-paced world, words and phrases tend to come and go with the speed of a tweet. True meaning of some words may fade away and the word "awesome" is one of such victims . It is no longer the rare gem it once was. It's tossed around with such frequency that it has lost its genuine meaning.

We live in an age of overhype. Even the simplest of pleasures or everyday occurrences are branded as "awesome." That cup of coffee in the morning? Awesome. That funny cat video? Awesome.

Information and products zip by us at the speed of light. Social media and well-tailored marketing take a good care of retaining our attention. Every single thing that you can possibly buy has to be the best. It has to be awesome.

So, what can we do to salvage the true essence of "awesome"? It starts with a conscious effort to reserve it for the moments that are, actually awesome. It's a call to reevaluate our use of the word and to treat it with a little more reverence. We can ensure that "awesome" maintains its power to convey the extraordinary.

Of course, everything new and shiny has to be the awesome. But let's leave that for marketing campaigns and advertisement. Marketing has been like this forever and it's most likely not changing any time soon. 

Let's communicate like sane people with a soul, taste, style and actual sense of appreciation. Our daily lives will always be routine. Would you call a routine thing "awesome"? In some cases yes, but it's unlikely. And that's how it should be. It's crucial to bring back the power and importance of the word. It should serve as a highlighter for experiences that truly take our breath away.
