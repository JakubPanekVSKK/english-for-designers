# My work
## **Telmex Redbull F1** (2023) 
Telmex F1 Project consists of 23 short spots - one for each race in the F1 season.

The spots show mexican F1 RedBull driver Sergio Perez exploring wonders of all the countries hosting the races.
Every spot is stylized in painting style of chosen painter from each country.

In the beginning of the project I worked on the main 3D assets, such as the F1 car, the character and the racing helmet. Then through out the process, my task was to compose exported animations into 3D environmet, take care of the scene textures and lighting and carry out the final render with all necessary masks and passes ready for final compositing and VFX.

## **Disconnected** (2023)
Disconnected is my final project from second year of studies on VÅ KK - Animations & VFX. The task was to create at least 30 seconds long movie with theme of "Hidden world".

The are two hidden worlds in my story. The first one is in the mind of the main character. He is experiencing something, that to him is just a dream. The second one is the actual world, that has been kept from him.

I wanted the theme of my movie to be dark, dreamy and surrealistic. Many scenes were inspired by backrooms and different kinds of liminal spaces. Because of such theme, I wanted the movie to be little bit confusing and abstract. It was supposed to feel like you are watching your own weird dream. It doesn't make any sense but at the same time, it kinda does. 

The project took approximately 3 weeks to finish.

## **Blockstar VR** (2022)
Blockstar VR is an arcade first-person shooter videogame made for Meta Quest & PC VR platforms.

The gameplay consists of 40 levels across which you're destroying and dodging blocks and enemies. You get to choose from variety of guns, secondary attacks and bonuses. There are also multiple playing modes, such as deathmatch or party mode.

I made some of the 3D assets and textures for the game as well as the main lobby room.
