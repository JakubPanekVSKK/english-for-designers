# My work
## **Telmex Redbull F1** (2023) 
Telmex F1 Project consists of 23 short spots - one for each race in the F1 season.
The spots show mexican F1 RedBull driver Sergio Perez exploring wonders of all the countries hosting the races.
Every spot is stylized in painting style of chosen painter from each country.

## **Disconnected** (2023)
Disconnected is my final project from second year of studies on VÅ KK - Animations & VFX
The task was to create at least 30 seconds long movie with theme of "Hidden world"
I wanted the theme of my movie to be dark, dreamy and surrealistic. Many scenes were inspired by backrooms and different kinds of liminal spaces. Because of such theme, I wanted the story to be a bit confusing and abstract. It was supposed to feel like if you are watching your own weird dream. It doesn't make any sense but at the same time, it kinda does. 

The project took approx. 3 weeks to finish
