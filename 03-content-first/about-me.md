## My dumb perfectionism and laziness got me into 3D art

Since my child hood, I basically had two main interests. Cars and architecture.


When I was young, my brother wanted to be an architect. He sketched many different houses and buildings. This somehow influenced me and got me into architecture too. And the cars? I genuinely have no idea. Noone in my family is a car guy, nor any of my friends. But it stuck with me till today and it's certainly not going away anytime soon.


But why am I writing this? Because these hobbies basically connect my whole "artistic journey" since the beginning. All I did back in the kindergarten was drawing cars. I made my first 3D houses in Google SketchUp when I was 8 years old. I got into photography because of car spotting.


After few years I started to photograph all kinds of things including the architecture. But what always bothered me the most, especially with the automotive photography, was the lack of control. Mostly lack of control over the environment in which I was shooting. Most of the time, this resulted in me spending 10 hours editing the photo and retouching every single bit that felt "disruptive". 


Also after some time I realized I actually enjoy more the editing part then the actual shooting. I'm not sure, if it was because I was just lazy to go shoot, but it definitely had something to do with that dumb perfectionism.


So after some time I tried Blender and got into 3D art. It was difficult and extremely confusing. As it is for every beginner. But the sense of freedom that you get after you learn such powerful softwares is totally amazing. And for me the freedom also meant total control over everything. Everything I want to make and express can be absolutely perfect. At least in my eyes.
