## My dumb perfectionism and laziness got me into 3D art

Since my child hood, I basically had two main interests. Cars and architecture.


When I was young, my brother wanted to be an architect. He sketched many different houses and buildings. This somehow influenced me and got me into architecture too. And the cars? I genuinely have no idea. Noone in my family is a car guy, nor any of my friends. But it stuck with me till today and it's certainly not going away anytime soon.


But why am I writing this? Because these hobbies basically connect my whole "artistic journey" since the beginning. All I did back in the kindergarten was drawing cars. I made my first 3D houses in Google SketchUp when I was 7 years old. I got into photography because of car spotting.


After few years I started to photograph all kinds of things including the architecture. But what always bothered me the most, especially with the automotive photography, was the lack of control. Mostly lack of control over the environment in which I was shooting. Most of the time, this resulted in me spending 10 hours editing the photo and retouching every single bit that felt "disruptive". 


Also after some time I realized I actually enjoy more the editing part then the actual shooting. I'm not sure, if it was because I was just lazy to go shoot outside, but it definitely had something to do with that dumb perfectionism.


So after some time I tried Blender and got into 3D art. It was difficult and extremely confusing. As it is for every beginner. But the sense of freedom that you get after you learn such powerful softwares is totally amazing. And for me the freedom also meant total control over everything. Everything I want to be perfect can be perfect. At least in my eyes.

## What am I doing when I'm not currently 3Ding

As much as I love looking at cars and connecting them with my work I obviously love to drive them too. Through out the summer you would often find me bashing the backroads behind my hometown and in the winter I enjoy some racing sim from the comfort of my desktop. I like motorsport and competitive driving in general so I always tend to enhance my driving technique and retain the driving skills I gained by simply training and driving. 

But at the end of the day, driving like this on public roads can sometimes be dangerous so I'm always paying attention to my surroundings and road conditions and try to take as little risk as possible. I'm looking forward to hopefuly soon buy a proper car that will be able to withstand occasional trackdays at the racing circuit.

Me and my girlfriend also love all sorts of EDM music so we often visit dance clubs and EDM events in Prague and every summer we visit some bigger foreign EDM festivals.
