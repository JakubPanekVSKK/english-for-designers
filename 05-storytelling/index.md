**FUTURE AND MOTIVATION**

Welcome to my presentation! 
Today I will talk about the future and motivation. 
I will tell you how I percieved my future and motivation in the past and how I see it now.

To better understand the future, first we need to look into the past.

**PAST**

During my highschool years I used to fear the future a lot.
I studied at gymnasium school in hometown for 8 years.

I had many very good friends and a supporting family. But I felt really miserable about myself.
Others always had better marks, they seemed smarter and more skilled.

Because of this I really lacked any kind of motivation.
I always thought that I am no good for anything.

I was waving the white flag before anything even started.
I was too worried of failing and being bad at yet another thing.

Prime example of this was my sport

I did athletics for 10 years. 
Most of my friends were pushing themselves to the limit and spent most of their free time training.
I was training because I was told to. 

I had pretty good results but I never thought to myself
"I really want to be good at this"

My trainer told me several times that I could easily be better than most of them if I wanted to.
But I couldn't get myself to push harder. I didn't have any dedication nor motivation to get better at it.

As a car enthusiast I watched lots of F1 races.
Whenever any of the drivers were interviewed and asked what is their goal in the sport, their answers were mostly the same:
"I want to be the world champion"

And I was absolutely not getting it.

I knew that 80% of them have near to zero chance of ever becoming a world champion.
If there is such a low chance and it is this hard then why even try and set such unreal goals?

And that was my vibe.

Long story short, the end of my highschool studies was getting closer and closer

I didn't know what I want to do next
I had no motivation
I had no dedication
I wasn't even sure if I will be able to pass the final exams nor if I will get accepted to any good university.

I had many creative hobbies but I never really thought that these would be useful as anything more than a hobby.
So from the really narrow perception of future possibilities that my highschool offered to me I saw it like this:

I suck at math

I suck at physics

I suck at chemistry

Geography is boring

Art = no money

Social sciences and history seem fine

So I thought - Guess I will study the law then

With your shitty marks? Lol good joke.
It's difficult af, u got no chance!
U really think u can withstand 5 years of studies without messing up? Bruh.

But then a few weird things happened

I passed the final highschool exams with decent results.
I got accepted to law university in Brno, also with decent results.

And I thought to myself.

So I am not that miserable after all?
What was it then?

Only recently I talked about this past situation with my highschool friends.
After some discussion we actually realized that we more or less all had the same feeling.
And it all had more or less the same source.

Our highschool teachers.

We were told we suck on such basis that even the smartest and most succesful of my former classmates felt like miserable shit.
There were several people who completely changed their field of interest and university the second year right after finishing the highschool.
Vast amount of them actually went to more difficult studies, which previously felt totally unachievable to them. 
Mostly because of the teachers of those subjects that tought them such bs.

As you can see I changed my field too.
I quickly realized that the law is absolutely nothing for me and I left after the first semester.

It took me just the first half year of being outside this toxic shithole of highschool to actually open my eyes and focus more on the things that I really care about

Only then I started to realize all the possibilities I have and that it's totally possible to actually make a living of what I love.

And that led me to where I am now.

For the first time in my life I am actually motivated and I can honestly say that I want to be the best at something.

Or am I?

**FUTURE**

Future may not be that bright.
Especially for us digital creators.

AI will be most likely taking some jobs.
Nobody just yet knows how many and which ones.

So I thought - How can I survive this and possibly make the most out of it.
I listened to bunch of smart and succesful people and created:

**How to not get ef'd by AI aka My list of 5 useful future skills**

Disclaimer: This may turn out to be complete bs in the future but who knows lol

1) Become freelancer or work in smaller studios
- You are less likely to get completely replaced by AI if you work by yourself or in a small team
- AI can actually make your work easier and you can use it to speed up/bypass certain pipeline steps.

- Bigger studios with thorough and expensive pipelines are less likely to be flexible to extreme changes in the technologies
- There are many separate work positions for every little step in the pipeline that can be erased or replaced
- This will over time probably lead to big layoffs or bankruptcy of such big companies

2) Do not necesseraly try to master one thing only
- If there's chance of your work being replaced, endlessly mastering one skill only can be kinda dangerous
- Instead try to skill stack

3) Skill stack
- The more skills you gain, the less likely you are to be replaced
- You have much bigger chance of "survival" if you're a multiskilled creator

4) Learn how to best sell your skills
- The skills and tools you have mastered do not disapper over night when a new AI tool gets released
- As long as you are able to sell your work and skills to someone, you still have a job. No matter if AI can replace you or not

5) Be ready to let go of things
- If that moment really comes and there will be some new magical tool that will be able to replace half of your skills, don't be overly emotional and be ready to let go of them
- Our jobs are unfortunately really emotionaly bound to us, but not sticking to outdated inefficient tools can save you lots of time and money
- And who knows, maybe some time after, the unique characteristics of such tools will be trendy and wanted again and you will be ready on the marks with your old new skills

I always tend to be a little too pesimistic but to be honest, even I believe that the future will not be as dark as it may seem. 
So donâ€˜t stress too much and be ready for new challenges and oppurtunities!

Thank you!
