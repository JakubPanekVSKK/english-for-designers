During my highschool years I used to fear the future a lot.

I felt really miserable about myself.
Others always had better marks, they seemed smarter and more skilled.

Because of this I really lacked any kind of motivation.
I always thought that I am no good for anything.

I was waving the white flag before anything even started.
I was too worried of failing and being bad at yet another thing.

Prime example of this was my sport

I did athletics for 10 years. 
Most of my friends there were pushing themselves to the limit and spent most of their free time training.
I was training because I was told to. 

I had pretty good results but I never thought to myself
"I want to be really good at this"

My trainer told me several times that I could easily be better than most of them if I wanted to.
But I couldn't get myself to push. I didn't have any dedication nor motivation to be better at it.

As a car enthusiast I watched lots of F1 races.
Whenever any of the drivers were interviewed and asked what is their goal in the sport, their replys were mostly the same:
"I want to be the world champion"

And I was absolutely not getting it.
I knew that 80% of them have near to zero chance at ever becoming a world champion
If there is such a low chance and it is this hard then why even try and set such unreal goals?

And that was my vibe.

Long story short the end of my highschool studies were getting closer and closer

I didn't know what I want to do next
I had no motivation
I had no dedication
I wasn't even sure if I will be able to pass the final exams nor if I will get accepted to any good university.

I had many creative hobbies but I never really thought that these would be useful as anything more than a hobby.
So from the really narrow perception of future possibilities that my highschool offered to me I saw it like this:

I suck at math
I suck at physics
I suck at chemistry
Geography is boring
Art = no money
Social sciences and history seem fine

Guess I will study the law then

With your shitty marks? Lol good joke.
It's difficult af, u got no chance!
U really think u can withstand 5 years of studies without messing up?

But then a few weird things happened

I passed the final highschool exams with decent results.
I got accepted to law university in Brno, also with decent results.

And I thought to myself.

So I am not that miserable after all?

Only recently I talked about this past situation with my highschool friends.
After some discussion we actually realized that we more or less all had the same feeling.
And it all had more or less the same source.

Our highschool teachers.

We were told we suck on such basis that even the smartest and most succesful of my former classmates felt like shit.
There were several people who completely changed their field of interest and university the second year right after finishing the highschool.
Vast amount of them actually went to more difficult studies, which previously felt totally unachievable to them. 
Mostly because of the teachers that tought them such bs.

As you can see I changed my university too.
I quickly realized that law is absolutely nothing for me and I left after first semester.

It took me just the first half year of being outside this shithole of highschool to actually open my eyes and focus more on the things that I really care about

Only then I started to realize all the possibilities I have and that it's totally possible to actually make a living of what I love.

And that led me to where I am now.
For the first time in my life I am actually motivated and I can honestly say that I want to be best at something.
