# **Voice, Tone and Style**

## **VOICE**

**Polite and calm**

I mostly try to be as calm and polite as possible, even in situations where others would loose their temper and feel like there's no more space for any politness. Overall I would say I'm mostly passive and conflictless person that tryies to find compromises and mutual ways and always try to understand the countreparty.

**Proffesional and disciplined**

I'm able to stand my ground when needed and explain my points in a calm and proffesional manner or take constructive critisism. I believe that unproductive conflict and agressivity won't move us anywhere and it only builds walls between us and makes everything more difficult. This is also really connected to good discipline. I'm able to admit my mistakes and be unbiased towards opinions of others. I can keep my head down when I should. The more I hate when people are not able to do the same.

**Open and emphatetic**

I'm mostly open to new ideas and new people. I like to work in a team and help build things with amazing ideas of others. But I also hate working in a team with people that are not team players. I love constructive debate and hate people that take everything personally. I always try to be as polite and empthatetic as possible. And from what I heard, people around me actually feel and appreciate this. But there are just times when certain people unnecessarily take things too personally. Debating with them then feels like a stroll through a mine field. You just don't know if your next step is gonna cause another explosion or not. Working with these people is just impossible and they are the complete opposite of what I'm trying to be.

## **TONE**

**Natural and friendly**

I'm a bit of an introvert so not everyone may see me like this, but if I'm around my friends or even around new people I always tend to be really natural and friendly. Sometimes I may fight with my native face expression, that to some my seem a little too "serial murderer like", so mostly people that don't know me may think that I hate them or I am bored to death. But fortunately everyone who get to know me better know that I am not like this.

**Openminded**

As I said, I love open and unbiased debate about anything with likeminded people. I'm trying to be serious and to understand what are others bringing to the table. Mostly I'm not trying to convince anyone that my opinion is the better nor the best one. I believe that it's much better to get to know opinions of others and that I can mostly benefit from this more.

**Optimistic**

Even though I am mostly self critic about myself I always tend to be supportive and pass on positive vibes on others, especially when anyone opens up to me and seeks some advice or help. In may not seem like it, but I believe that you can always find some bright spots even in the thickest darkness.

## **STYLE**

When I'm writing informal between my friends, I tend to use lots of slang and mix up english and czech. We also use many different memes between my friends so I frequently use some references to them in my text too. And when that happens the language cant get... well, really creative. But of course, when it comes to formal language and proffesional matter, I can write really well and politely. Lately, I tend to use a few exclamation marks in my formal texts because I feel it makes it a little more energetic. But other than that, I'm oldschool with it.
