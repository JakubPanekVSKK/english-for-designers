# **Voice, Tone and Style**

## **VOICE**

**Polite and calm**

I mostly try to be as calm and polite as possible, even in situations where others would lose their temper and feel like there's no more space for any politeness. Overall I would say I'm mostly a passive and conflictless person who tries to find compromises and mutual ways and always wants to understand the counterparty.

**Professional and disciplined**

I'm able to stand my ground when needed and explain my points calmly and professionally or take constructive criticism. I believe that unproductive conflict and aggression won't move us anywhere and it only builds walls between us and makes everything more difficult. This is also really connected to good discipline. I'm able to admit my mistakes and be unbiased towards the opinions of others. I can keep my head down when I should. The more I hate when people are not able to do the same. And I have a feeling that this is unfortunately more and more common 

**Open and empathetic**

I'm mostly open to new ideas and new people. I like to work in a team and help build things with the amazing ideas of others. But I also hate working in a team with people that are not team players. I love constructive debate and hate people who take everything personally. I always try to be as polite and empathetic as possible. And from what I heard, people around me actually feel and appreciate this. But there are just times when certain people unnecessarily take things too personally. Debating with them then feels like a stroll through a minefield. You just don't know if your next step is gonna cause another explosion or not. Working with these people is just impossible and they are the complete opposite of what I'm trying to be.

## **TONE**

**Natural and friendly**

I'm a bit of an introvert so not everyone may see me like this, but if I'm around my friends or even around new people I always tend to be natural and friendly. Sometimes I may fight with my native facial expression, which to some may seem a little too "serial murderer-like". So mostly people who don't know me may think that I hate them or I am bored to death. But fortunately, everyone who gets to know me better knows that I am not like this.

**Openminded**

As I said, I love open and unbiased debates about anything with like-minded people. I'm trying to be serious and understand what are others bringing to the table. Mostly I'm not trying to convince anyone that my opinion is the better or the best one. I believe that it's much better to get to know the opinions of others and that I can mostly benefit from this more.

**Optimistic**

Even though I am mostly self-critic about myself I always tend to be supportive and pass on positive vibes to others, especially when anyone opens up to me and seeks some advice or help. It may not seem like it, but I believe that you can always find some bright spots even in the thickest darkness.

## **STYLE**

When I'm writing informally with my friends, I tend to use lots of slang and mix up English and Czech. We also use many different memes between us so I frequently use some references to them in my text too. And when that happens, the language can't get... well, really creative. But of course, when it comes to formal language and professional matters, I can write well and politely. Lately, I tend to use a few exclamation marks in my formal texts because I feel it makes it a little more energetic. But other than that, I keep it old school.
