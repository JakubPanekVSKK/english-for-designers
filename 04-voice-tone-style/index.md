## **Voice, Tone and Style**

# **VOICE**

**Polite and calm**

I mostly try to be as calm and polite as possible, even in situations where others would loose their temper and feel like there's no more space for any politness. Overall I would say I'm mostly passive and conflictless person that tryies to find compromises and mutual ways and always try to understand the countreparty.

**Proffesional and disciplined**

I'm able to stand my ground when needed and explain my points in a calm and proffesional manner or take constructive critisism. I believe that unproductive conflict and agressivity won't move us anywhere and it only builds walls between us and makes everything more difficult. This is also really connected to good discipline. I'm able to admit my mistakes and be unbiased towards opinions of others. I can keep my head down when I should. The more I hate when people are not able to do the same.

**Open and emphatetic**

I'm mostly open to new ideas and new people. I like to work in a team and help build things with amazing ideas of others. But I also hate working in a team with people that are not team players. I love constructive debate and hate people that take everything personally. I always try to be as polite and empthatetic as possible. And from what I heard, people around me actually feel and appreciate this. But there are just times when certain people unnecessarily take things too personally. Debating with them then feels like a stroll through a mine field. You just don't know if your next step is gonna cause another explosion or not. And these people are the complete opposite of what I'm trying to be.
